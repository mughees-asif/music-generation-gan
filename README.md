## Abstract ðŸ§¾

Domain-style transfer for text, images, and music, has recently gained traction to enable creative and original digital content generation. The current trends in research for musical generation align with using deep neural networks due to the vast computational power and feasibility for producing varying styles of content. Following this light, the author has investigated and implemented the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the Wasserstein Loss function to generate original musical snippets using symbolic notation. The dataset was sourced in a piano roll format, a widely used and accepted form of representing various musical tones and pitches. The GAN system was trained and tested in various configurations that show promising results. The generation of the output was aided by adding accompaniments that augment the original input samples with different tones and pitches to produce qualitatively pleasing music content.
